<p>Hello, my name is Adrian Hernandez. I am a software engineering student with a background in the medical field as well as the customer service industry. I recently exited the Army after 6 years of service as an Army nurse. Being in the military taught me the importance of teamwork and nursing helped me hone my interpersonal skills. I love the challenge software engineering is providing me and I look forward to seeing what I can contribute to the field.</p>
