# Collaborators

Devon, Sharmarke, Ryan, Adrian

GIT- Date is an app for those in the tech world for them to connect with each other and see a a list of interests that they have and match with them. Our application makes it easy for an individual to meet other singles via an online application. It takes away the need to meet someone in person first in order to get to know them. This gives you the chance to get to know someone before you commit to an actual meetup in person. It also helps you find people with similar interests so it makes looking for someone with those interests a little easier.

## Cooperation Plan

Strengths:

Sharmarke: Being empathic Ryan: CSS Adrian: Communication Devon: Researching

We can best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project by working as a team and utilizing each others strengths to accomplish and finish our midterm gracefully.

Professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength:

Sharmarke: Technical writing Ryan: Technical writing Adrian: Technical writing  Devon: Technical writing

We plan to approach the day-to-day work by commincating what we want to accomplish.

## Conflict Plan

Our group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises will be to commincate with one another to solve conflicts.

If one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute, we have a meeting about it and have a conversation on that conflict.

Seeing each others commits to see and have morning meeting do discuss problems and work together if the problem arises, is how we would approach those concerns.

We will raise those concerns through slack or our morning meetings is how we would raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing.

Having a 3 strike rule, then have a conversation with Alex and Rey about it once it reaches the 3rd strike.

## Communication Plan

From 9 am - 6 pm and possibly after hours.

The platform we will be using is Slack, Remo, and Zoom.

One break every hour, one hour break at lunch.

Working after hours if we fall behind.

We will be communicating after hours and on the weekend through Slack, Remo, and Zoom.

The strategy to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard is by having honest feedback on how everyone is doing.

We will ensure that we are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up by being empathetic on each other and also make sure we are all on the same page.

## Work Plan

Communicate in Slack, Remo, Zoom, and a GitHub project tool on what task we split into doing and have a discussion where we are, when we are stuck, and when we are complete. 

Github will be used is the project management tool.

## Presentation Deck

## Git Process

HTML, Java, and CSS will the be components on Github.

We are all collaborators so we will have copies of the repos.

The Git flow will be everything on the staging branch with a new name and then each day have one branch for a specific implementation that would be merged into the staging branch.

Everyone review staging into main. Won't merge our own code. At the end of the day we will merge into the staging branch. Commnicate in remo/zoom/slack when it is time to merge.

What is the vision of this product?

The vision of this project is to create a dating app, where users may quickly and efficiently find matches to potential love interests. A user may add and remove preferences of what they are looking for in a person. A user may also add and remove matches, as well as send and receive messages from other users they matched with. 

What pain point does this project solve?

The pain point this project solves is preventing the user from having to date the “old fashioned” way. Instead of having to go out to an event to meet people, users may connect with users who are ready and willing. Users also may see if they have common interests with other users before matching as well as be able to see a picture of them. 

Why should we care about your product?

You should care about our project because connection is important. A lot of people are looking for a genuine connection, but struggle with the process of finding a compatible person to date. Our app simplifies that process, while taking some of the guesswork out of the process.

Data Flow

Users come to the site and are prompted to log in or register. Upon registration, the user inputs personal information, including a username, password, and their name, as well as preferences based on what they are looking for in the dating app. Age will be verified, ensuring only users who are 18 or above can register for the site. After registration, users will be taken to their homepage where they can view and update their information. From there a user will be able to view a list of potential matches based on their profile preferences. If two users match with each other, they will be able to exchange messages with one another as well as delete messages. Users then will be able to delete users. Users may then log out of the site. 

Non-Functional Requirements 

Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

Spring Security is used for authentication, protection from cross site scripting, and giving users access only to information they are authorized to view or manipulate.

Usability/Accessibility ensuring this app is able to be used by everyone is of age to date. App will be clean, as well as friendly for use of any race, gender, ethnic background, and sexual preference. 

Testability/ Get/Put functions unit tests, within the app.

Ease of use
