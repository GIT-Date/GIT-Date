## Cooperation Plan

Strengths:

Sharmarke: Being empathic Ryan: CSS Adrian: Communication Devon: Researching

We can best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project by working as a team and utilizing each others strengths to accomplish and finish our midterm gracefully.

Professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength:

Sharmarke: Technical writing Ryan: Technical writing Adrian: Technical writing  Devon: Technical writing

We plan to approach the day-to-day work by commincating what we want to accomplish.

## Conflict Plan

Our group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises will be to commincate with one another to solve conflicts.

If one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute, we have a meeting about it and have a conversation on that conflict.

Seeing each others commits to see and have morning meeting do discuss problems and work together if the problem arises, is how we would approach those concerns.

We will raise those concerns through slack or our morning meetings is how we would raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing.

Having a 3 strike rule, then have a conversation with Alex and Rey about it once it reaches the 3rd strike.

## Communication Plan

From 9 am - 6 pm and possibly after hours.

The platform we will be using is Slack, Remo, and Zoom.

One break every hour, one hour break at lunch.

Working after hours if we fall behind.

We will be communicating after hours and on the weekend through Slack, Remo, and Zoom.

The strategy to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard is by having honest feedback on how everyone is doing.

We will ensure that we are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up by being empathetic on each other and also make sure we are all on the same page.

## Work Plan

Communicate in Slack, Remo, Zoom, and a GitHub project tool on what task we split into doing and have a discussion where we are, when we are stuck, and when we are complete. 

Github will be used is the project management tool.

## Git Process

HTML, Java, and CSS will the be components on Github.

We are all collaborators so we will have copies of the repos.

The Git flow will be everything on the staging branch with a new name and then each day have one branch for a specific implementation that would be merged into the staging branch.

Everyone review staging into main. Won't merge our own code. At the end of the day we will merge into the staging branch. Commnicate in remo/zoom/slack when it is time to merge.

# Project Prep 2
Summary:

A dating app where users are able to create a user, log in, and are able to see/find matches with other people. Able to list interests for others to see.

Problem Pain

GIT Date is a break from traditional dating. Our app provides a more efficient and faster method to matching than traditional dating. Being able to match with people who have similar/common interest.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

Create a user, log in, user able to create a post of their interest, users are able to interact with each other.
